  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>Billy Blanks developed the routine in 1976 by combining dance with elements from his martial arts and boxing training to form a workout regimen.
  During the 1990s, a series of videos were mass-marketed to the public;
  by 1999 an estimated 1.5 million sets of videos had been sold on the back of a frequently aired television infomercial.
  As a result, Tae Bo became somewhat of a pop culture phenomenon in the late 1990s.
  Gyms began offering Kickboxing-based fitness classes similar to Tae Bo.
  Since Blanks had taken out a trademark on the name they were not allowed to use the term Tae Bo without paying a licensing fee.
  Tae Bo videos and DVDs continue to rank among the top sellers in the fitness genre and derivative classes are still offered at many gyms.</p>
